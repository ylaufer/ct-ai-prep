### üîÅ True/False

**6. Risk-based testing focuses on parts of the system with the highest uncertainty.**  
**7. Data imbalance means all classes are equally represented.**  
**8. Noise in data refers to intentional bias.**  
**9. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can help detect bias in datasets.**  
**10. Pairwise testing is best for finding model overfitting.**
