# Testing Non-ML Components in AI-Based Systems

While much attention is given to testing the ML models in AI-based systems, it's equally important to test the non-ML components. These include business logic, user interfaces, rule engines, and control structures.

## Topics Covered
- Identifying non-AI components
- Testing strategies for deterministic parts
- Hybrid testing approach (AI + traditional systems)
- Separation of concerns and interface testing

---

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Classic black-box and white-box testing techniques apply directly to non-AI components.
