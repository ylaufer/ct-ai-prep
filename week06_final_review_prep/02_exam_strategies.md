# 🧠 CT-AI Exam Strategy Tips

## 💡 Answering Questions
- Always think: "What’s the AI system under test?"
- Focus on **data**, **metrics**, **intent**, and **risks**
- Look for keywords: fairness, robustness, test coverage, transparency

## 🎯 Time Management
- ~75 seconds per question (60 questions in 75 minutes)
- Mark questions you're unsure of and return later
- Expect ~30–40% scenario-based or multi-step logic

## ❌ Common Pitfalls
- Confusing accuracy with F1
- Ignoring the role of data (bias, leakage, drift)
- Forgetting test oracles in probabilistic systems
- Assuming rule-based logic when it’s AI/ML-driven
