# Week 5: AI-Driven Testing & Future of QA

## Key Concepts

### AI-Driven Testing
AI-driven testing refers to the use of machine learning and AI technologies to support or automate QA tasks like test generation, prioritization, execution, maintenance, and result analysis.

### Intelligent Automation vs Traditional Automation
- **Traditional**: Rule-based, deterministic scripts
- **Intelligent**: Uses historical data, adapts to change, self-heals

### Common Applications
- Test case generation from natural language
- Predictive defect analysis
- Root cause analysis using ML
- Test impact analysis and prioritization
- Self-healing tests
- AI in CI/CD pipelines

### Future QE Skills
- AI/ML understanding
- Data literacy
- Explainability tools
- Ethical and regulatory awareness
