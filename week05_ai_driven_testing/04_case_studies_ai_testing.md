# Real-World Case Studies: AI in QA

## 1. Google – Predicting Flaky Tests
Google uses ML models trained on test execution data to detect and deprioritize flaky tests before they block CI/CD pipelines.

## 2. Meta – RL-Based UI Coverage
Meta applies reinforcement learning to optimize UI testing coverage in mobile apps, choosing navigation paths that maximize feature coverage.

## 3. GitHub Copilot QA Bots
Some teams use Copilot in combination with GitHub Actions to auto-generate tests and update them as code changes, reducing maintenance effort.

## 4. Spotify – Root Cause Analysis via ML
Spotify applies clustering and anomaly detection on logs and test outputs to find the likely root cause of failure across services.
