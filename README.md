### ðŸ“ˆ Visual Maps by Chapter (Objectives + Notebooks)
Each chapter includes a mindmap-style visual that summarizes:
- Main learning objectives
- Real-world examples
- Link to Jupyter notebook

**[ðŸ‘‰ Visual Maps Folder](notebooks/_visual-maps)**

For each chapter, the naming follows: `map_chapter_<number>_<topic>.png`

### ðŸ”§ Chapter 9 CI/CD Recommendation

**Enhancement for Test Environments and Tools:**

You can further enrich Chapter 9 by integrating a real CI/CD pipeline setup:
- Use **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** to run model evaluation scripts
- Include integration with testing tools like `pytest`, `great_expectations`, or `DeepEval`
- Automate evaluation of fairness, accuracy, and explainability using your notebooks as job steps
